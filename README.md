I've just completed building Yummy App but this time by using "Tailwind", a web application that makes discovering meals fun and easy! Here’s what it includes:

🍽️ Random Meals: Every time you open the app, you’ll see a selection of random meal options to inspire your next meal!

📜 Detailed Meal Information: Click on any meal to get all the details, like:

Meal Area 🌍 

Category 🍗

Recipe 📝

Tags, and links to videos or source pages

🔎 Search, Filter & Explore:

-Search by meal name or first letter

-Browse by Category (e.g., Chicken, Beef, Vegan)

-Explore by Area for meals from different regions

-Search by Ingredients to find meals based on what’s in your kitchen

-📞 Contact Form: Submit your info with real-time form validation to get in touch, all with smooth and clean UX!
